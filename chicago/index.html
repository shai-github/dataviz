                        In Chicago, the erosion of the middle class started well before the economic downturn in 2008.

                    Between 2000 and 2014, the median household income plummeted nationwide. As a result, the middle class decreased across metropolitan 
                    areas in the Rust Belt, where local economies have heavily relied on manufacturing. This shift represents an increase in 
                    income inequality, where - on average - the proportion of the lower and upper classes increased as the relative share of the 
                    middle class dropped.

                <p class="subtext">
                    The decline of the middle class in Chicago - the third-most populous city in the United States - began well before the turn of the
                    millennium. According to the Nathalie P. Voorhees Center for Neighborhood and Community Improvement at the University of Illinois at 
                    Chicago, the middle class comprised roughly half of the city's census tracts during the 1970s, while lower-income and higher-income 
                    communities constituted 42% and 8% of Chicago, respectively. By 2016, middle-income Chicago accounted for just 16% of the city's census 
                    tracts while the lower-income and higher-income shares increased to 62% and 22%, respectively.

                    Note: Researchers at the Voorhees Center determined income categories by calculating the average per capita income across the
                    Chicago metropolitation region for each decade of the U.S. Census as of 1970. Communities were assessed at the census tract level,
                    with 793 census tracts assessed in the city region and 1,976 tracts assessed in the broader seven-county region. Researchers at the 
                    Voorhees Center defined "middle class" tracts as having an average per capita income between 80 and 120 percent of regional average
                    for a given year. Tracts were only assessed if average per capita income was between $28,712 and $43,068. At the time of publishing, 
                    decennial U.S. Census data was not available and, as such, five year estimates from the 2012-2016 American Community Survey were 
                    used. Census tracts were analyzed according to 2010 U.S. Census boundaries.

                While middle-income communities accounted for roughly half of Chicago in 1970, today - on average - most neighborhoods in the city
                tend to be either low-income or high-income. Using income categorization determined by the University of Illinois at Chicago, the 
                following maps show this trend over time according to each tract's average per capita income. "Very High" income entails average
                per capita income 40 percent above the regional seven-county average while "High" income means 20 percent above the average. 
                "Very Low" income tracts are those with average per capita income 40 percent below the average while "Low" income tracts are those
                with average per capita income 20 percent below the average. Lastly, "Middle" income tracts have average per capita income in a 
                range 20 percent below and above the regional average.

                                In 1970, middle-income areas made up roughly half of all neighborhoods in Chicago. Large groups of
                                middle-income neighborhoods could be found on all sides of the city, though the northern Lake Michigan 
                                coast largely consisted of high-income neighborhoods. On the other hand, low-income neighborhoods were 
                                scattered across the south side of the city, with very low-income areas concentrated in the central-south 
                                and west.

                                By 1980, there was an evident shift in the distribution of income in Chicago. Very low-income areas
                                in the west and south sides of the city expanded further in each direction. Several middle-income tracts
                                in the north became low-income areas while some low and middle-income neighborhoods on the northern coast
                                became high-income neighborhoods.

                                During the decade leading up to 1990, many census tracts moved from the low-income category to the very low-income category -
                                particularly on the south and west sides of Chicago. Several middle and low-income neighborhoods adjacent
                                to high and very high-income neighborhoods near the northern coast became high-income areas while a number
                                of middle-income tracts in the northwest corner of the city became low-income. The southeastern edge
                                of the city transitioned from majority middle-income to majority low-income.

                                2000 saw the single largest leap toward 
                                income segregation in Chicago. Some low-income areas adjacent to high-income areas transitioned to middle-income
                                neighborhoods while a collection of middle-income neighborhoods in the north became high-income. Nevertheless,
                                large swathes of middle-income tracts in the northwest and southeast corners of the city became low-income areas
                                during this decade. A number of low-income neighborhoods transitioned to very low-income areas.

                                In 2010, Chicago experienced a striking gain in high-income tracts. Middle-income as well as low and very
                                low-income neighborhoods adjacent to high and very-high income neighborhoods on the north side transitioned to
                                high-income areas. On the other hand, the proportion of low-income neighborhoods marginally decreased, though 
                                not to the same level prior to the preceding decade. Notably, middle-income tracts as a share of the population
                                remained stable, though numerous low-income neighborhoods transitioned to very low-income areas.

                                rather than a decennial census. However, the figures show a more recent decline of the middle-class in Chicago with
                                a transition to high-income neighborhoods. Much of this has been attributed to an influx of high-income individuals
                                moving into already high-income and middle-income areas adjacent to high-income neighborhoods. Ultimately, the gradual
                                decline of the middle-class in Chicago led to staunch economic polarization. As of 2017, middle-income areas in Chicago
                                are restricted to the outskirts of the city in addition to pockets that straddle low-income and high-income neighborhoods.

                Based on the University of Toronto's Three Cities methodology, researchers at UIC segmented Chicago into three distinct locales.
                These "three cities" vary in characteristics related to race, age, ability, home ownership, household composition, and income, among other indicators.
                The census tracts that compose each of the three cities largely align with the the low, middle, and high-income distribution of Chicago, highlighting 
                the income segregation of the city along demographic and socioeconomic lines.

                                The researchers at UIC found that Chicago's outlined three cities experienced significant changes
                                in average per capita income over the five-decade period between 1970 and 2016. Tracts in City One
                                experienced a proportional 20 percent increase in regional income whereas areas in City Three experienced
                                a 20 percent decrease. Neighborhoods in City Two experienced a decrease in proportional income less than
                                20 percent on average.

                                With only 622,099 residents as of 2017, City One represents the smallest population of Chicago's three 
                                cities. The demographic composition of City One is 64% White, 13% Black or African American, 8% Asian,
                                13% Latinx, and 3% Other races. 45% of City One's White population earned more than $100,000 annually.
                                The city is comprised of the largest share of individuals between the ages of 20 and 34. Half of all
                                households in the city are only comprised of two individuals. 43.1% of residents
                                in City One own their homes while 56.9% reside in rented properties. The unemployment rate in City One
                                decreased to 4.5% in 2017 compared to 6.3% in 2010.

                                American, 7% Asian, 25% Latinx, and 2% Other races. Most individuals residing in City Two are between the
                                ages 35 and 64 and more than a third of households in the city have four or more people. Compared to the other

                                properties and 49.5% in owned properties. With 8.7% unemployment, City Two had unemployment nearly double

                                City Three represents the largest share of Chicago's overall population with 1,344,751 residents. The demographic
                                composition of City Three is 14% White, 42% Black or African American, 4% Asian, 39% Latinx, and 1% Other races. As of
                                2017, more than a third of the city's Black population earned less than $20,000 while more than half earned less than

                                age of 19 citywide, roughly 60% reside in City Three. However, the city also represents almost half of all individuals
                                over the age of 65, such that City Three is home to both a young and aging population. The composition of home ownership
                                and renting in City Three is similar to that of City One. The unemployment rate of City Three - 14.3% - was the largest of the three
                                cities in 2017; however, this rate only represented a marginal decrease from 14.4% in 2010.
